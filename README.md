# WeatherApp

A Qt5 based course work project which is able to monitor weather in any point in the world, supporting multiple languages thanks to https://openweathermap.org/api and https://opencagedata.com/api. 
Also the offline mode supports inter- and extrapolating existing cached records using polynomial Lagrange formula.
